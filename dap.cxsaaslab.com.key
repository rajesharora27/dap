I want to add "All" option to Outcomes and Release. All would mean a task is applicable to all the releases and outcomes. Rather than selecting individual releases or outcomes, All can be shortcut (or wildcard). This will apply to adoption plan filters as well. If you select All for outcomes or releases that means all outcomes or releases are selected.
