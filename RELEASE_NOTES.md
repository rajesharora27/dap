## Version 2.1.0 - Telemetry Enhancements & Task Status Improvements
**Release Date**: January 20, 2025  
**Tag**: `v2.1.0`  
**Status**: Production Ready ✅

### 🎯 Release Highlights

- 🔄 **NEW: NO_LONGER_USING Status** - Polite status for completed tasks no longer being used based on telemetry
- 🎯 **NEW: Re-evaluate Button** - Manual trigger for telemetry evaluation across all tasks
- 💾 **Auto-Save Telemetry Criteria** - No more lost threshold values, everything saves automatically

- 🎨 **UI Consistency** - Unified button styling, table layouts for product tasks, telemetry column
- 🐛 **Critical Fixes** - Async import, infinite loop, status persistence, connection issues

### 🌟 New Features

#### NO_LONGER_USING Task Status
- **New status type** for tasks completed but telemetry shows no longer in use
- **Automatic status updates** based on failed telemetry criteria evaluation
- **Status persistence** - doesn't revert to NOT_STARTED on re-evaluation
- **Visual indicator** - Warning color (orange) with TrendingDown icon
- **Polite naming** - More user-friendly than "Adoption Declined"

#### Re-evaluate All Tasks Button
- **Manual trigger** for telemetry evaluation across entire adoption plan
- **Assessment icon** for clear visual indication
- **Loading state** feedback during evaluation
- **Automatic updates** for all task statuses based on current telemetry data
- **Positioned in header** next to Export/Import buttons for easy access

#### Telemetry Auto-Save
- **Automatic saving** of success criteria as user makes changes
- **No intermediate save** button required - modern UX pattern
- **Change detection** to prevent infinite loops
- **Visual feedback** with "✓ Changes are saved automatically" message
- **Works for all criteria types** - boolean, number, string, timestamp

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

#### Backend Enhancements
- **New Evaluation Types**: STRING_NOT_NULL and TIMESTAMP_NOT_NULL criteria
- **Fixed Import Logic**: Promise.all() for proper async/await handling
- **Current Timestamps**: Telemetry imports use current time (not file date)
- **Status Persistence**: NO_LONGER_USING preserved on re-evaluation
- **Removed Debug Logging**: Cleaned up console.log statements from evaluation code

#### Frontend Enhancements
- **GraphQL Mutations**: EVALUATE_ALL_TASKS_TELEMETRY mutation added
- **isMet Field**: All telemetry queries include evaluation status
- **Telemetry Column**: Product task list shows configured attributes with chips
- **Table Layout**: Product tasks now use professional table structure
- **Consistent Buttons**: All action buttons have consistent styling
- **Import Dialog**: Rich feedback with summary, task details, and warnings

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Button Consistency**: All outlined, small size, with color props
- **Shortened Labels**: "Export Template", "Import Data", "Re-evaluate"
- **Table Headers**: Consistent styling across product and adoption task lists
- **Column Optimization**: Fixed widths, no text wrapping, professional appearance
- **Telemetry Chips**: Color-coded (green/orange/gray) based on configuration status

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- ✅ **Async Import Fixed**: Promise.all() ensures all operations complete before calculating results
- ✅ **Infinite Loop Fixed**: Change detection prevents auto-save from triggering re-renders
- ✅ **Status Revert Fixed**: NO_LONGER_USING no longer changes to NOT_STARTED on re-evaluation
- ✅ **Connection Fixed**: Relative URL for telemetry import (Vite proxy)
- ✅ **Criteria Lost Fixed**: Auto-save ensures threshold values persist
- ✅ **Timestamp Fixed**: Imports use current time for proper ordering
- ✅ **String Evaluation Fixed**: STRING_NOT_NULL criteria properly handles type conversion
