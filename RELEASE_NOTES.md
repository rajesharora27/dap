- **CSV Import/Export**: Full data portability with validation and error handling
- **Custom Attributes**: Flexible JSON-based metadata storage for extensibility

#### Technical Excellence
- **GraphQL API**: Type-safe schema with Relay compliance and comprehensive input validation
- **React Frontend**: Material-UI based interface with proper state management via Apollo Client
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust schema with proper foreign keys, junction tables, and soft deletion
- **Architecture Assessment**: **OPTIMAL** rating (5/5 stars) across all system layers

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Quality

#### Database Layer (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Proper entity relationships with clean Product ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Outcomes/Releases hierarchy
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships (TaskOutcome, TaskRelease)
- Comprehensive foreign key constraints with appropriate CASCADE/SET NULL behavior
- Consistent soft deletion pattern with `deletedAt` timestamps
- Business rule enforcement (tasks sum to 100% per product) at database level

#### GraphQL API (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Type-safe schema with comprehensive input/output types
- Relay specification compliance with Node interface
- Real-time capabilities via GraphQL subscriptions
- Flexible dual parenting (Tasks can belong to Products OR Solutions)
- Computed properties for dynamic calculations

#### Frontend Architecture (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Successfully unified three separate task editing dialogs
- Proper Apollo Client integration with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive form validation with business rule enforcement
- Consistent Material-UI theming and responsive design
- Shared GraphQL patterns for code reusability

#### Task-Product Modeling (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Weight management with 100% validation per product
- Sequence control with unique constraint enforcement
- Hierarchical licensing with proper inheritance
- Release-based task availability with automatic propagation
- Flexible outcome associations via many-to-many relationships

### üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Material-UI + Apollo Client
- **Backend**: Node.js + GraphQL + Apollo Server + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema design
- **Real-time**: GraphQL subscriptions via graphql-ws
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Containerization**: Docker/Podman support with database migrations

### üìà Performance & Security

#### Performance Features
- Efficient Prisma queries with proper relationship loading
- Apollo Client cache optimization for reduced network requests
- Real-time updates with selective GraphQL subscriptions
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets

#### Security Measures
- Comprehensive input validation at GraphQL resolver level
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- Proper data sanitization for user inputs

### üéâ Architecture Assessment Results
