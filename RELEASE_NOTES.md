# üöÄ DAP Release Notes

## Version 1.1.0 - Documentation Refresh & Repository Cleanup
**Release Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Tag**: `v1.1.0`  
**Status**: Production Ready ‚úÖ

### üéØ Release Highlights

- üßπ Removed 70+ legacy test harnesses, archived utilities, and exported spreadsheets to streamline the repository
- üóÇÔ∏è Expanded `.gitignore` and deleted committed build outputs to keep generated assets out of version control
- üìö Published a refreshed documentation suite with a new `ARCHITECTURE.md` and reorganized `README.md`
- üè∑Ô∏è Promoted both backend and frontend packages to version `1.1.0` for dependency managers and deployment tooling

### üóÇÔ∏è Documentation Refresh

- `README.md`: Introduced a documentation index, updated project structure diagrams, and clarified CSV workflows
- `QUICK_START.md`: Consolidated setup instructions around the `./dap` entrypoint and modernized onboarding steps
- `DAP-MANAGEMENT.md`: Simplified operational commands to the single `./dap` wrapper for tasks, seeds, and maintenance
- `CONFIG_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` & `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Synchronized environment variable guidance and container orchestration notes
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Captures tier responsibilities, GraphQL/data flows, and the current Prisma schema snapshot

### üß∞ Developer Experience

- Unified automation through the `./dap` helper script, reducing command drift between documents
- Eliminated redundant assets so fresh clones compile without manual cleanup
- Recorded release metadata in `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for easier audit trails

### üîÑ Upgrade Notes

- Remove any locally cached scripts or generated `dist` folders that were deleted upstream
- Update internal runbooks to reference the centralized documentation and `./dap` workflow
- Reinstall dependencies if local tooling relies on package manifests for version detection
- No database, GraphQL, or runtime changes‚Äîapplication behavior remains identical to 1.0.0

## Version 1.0.0 - Initial GA Release
**Release Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Tag**: `v1.0.0`  
**Status**: Production Ready ‚úÖ

### üéØ Release Highlights

This marks the **first general availability release** of the DAP (Data Application Platform) - a complete, production-ready task and product management system with exceptional architecture quality.

### ‚ú® Key Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Complete Task & Product Management System**: Full CRUD operations with hierarchical relationships
- **Unified Task Editing Interface**: Successfully consolidated all task editing dialogs for consistent UX
- **3-Tier Licensing System**: Essential, Advantage, and Signature levels with proper hierarchical access
- **Real-time Updates**: GraphQL subscriptions for live data synchronization across all components
- **CSV Import/Export**: Full data portability with validation and error handling
- **Custom Attributes**: Flexible JSON-based metadata storage for extensibility

#### Technical Excellence
- **GraphQL API**: Type-safe schema with Relay compliance and comprehensive input validation
- **React Frontend**: Material-UI based interface with proper state management via Apollo Client
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust schema with proper foreign keys, junction tables, and soft deletion
- **Architecture Assessment**: **OPTIMAL** rating (5/5 stars) across all system layers

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Quality

#### Database Layer (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Proper entity relationships with clean Product ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Outcomes/Releases hierarchy
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships (TaskOutcome, TaskRelease)
- Comprehensive foreign key constraints with appropriate CASCADE/SET NULL behavior
- Consistent soft deletion pattern with `deletedAt` timestamps
- Business rule enforcement (tasks sum to 100% per product) at database level

#### GraphQL API (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Type-safe schema with comprehensive input/output types
- Relay specification compliance with Node interface
- Real-time capabilities via GraphQL subscriptions
- Flexible dual parenting (Tasks can belong to Products OR Solutions)
- Computed properties for dynamic calculations

#### Frontend Architecture (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Successfully unified three separate task editing dialogs
- Proper Apollo Client integration with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive form validation with business rule enforcement
- Consistent Material-UI theming and responsive design
- Shared GraphQL patterns for code reusability

#### Task-Product Modeling (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- Weight management with 100% validation per product
- Sequence control with unique constraint enforcement
- Hierarchical licensing with proper inheritance
- Release-based task availability with automatic propagation
- Flexible outcome associations via many-to-many relationships

### üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Material-UI + Apollo Client
- **Backend**: Node.js + GraphQL + Apollo Server + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema design
- **Real-time**: GraphQL subscriptions via graphql-ws
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Containerization**: Docker/Podman support with database migrations

### üìà Performance & Security

#### Performance Features
- Efficient Prisma queries with proper relationship loading
- Apollo Client cache optimization for reduced network requests
