# Task Layout Alignment Improvement

## Overview
Updated the task list layout in both TasksPanel and App.tsx to ensure consistent alignment of all elements regardless of task name length.

## Changes Made

### Layout Structure
Changed from a flexible layout to a structured grid-like layout with fixed-width columns for consistent alignment:

1. **Sequence Number**: Fixed width (56px) - Always reserves space even if empty
2. **Task Name**: Flexible width (flex: 1) - Takes remaining space, truncates with ellipsis
3. **Weight**: Fixed width (80px) - Consistent alignment for all tasks
4. **How-to Links Container**: Fixed width (120px) - Right-aligned with individual link boxes (50px each)

### Key Improvements

#### Before
- Elements had variable spacing based on content length
- Short task names caused misalignment of weight and links
- Inconsistent visual hierarchy

#### After
- All columns align perfectly in a grid
- Short or long task names maintain consistent spacing
- Weight percentage always appears in same column
- How-to links always appear in same position
- Clean, professional appearance

### Implementation Details

#### Container Structure
```tsx
<Box sx={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', gap: 2, width: '100%' }}>
  {/* Sequence number - fixed width */}
  <Box sx={{ minWidth: '56px', flexShrink: 0 }}>
    {/* Chip with sequence number */}
  </Box>
  
  {/* Task name - flexible width */}
  <Box sx={{ flex: 1, minWidth: 0 }}>
    {/* Typography with ellipsis */}
  </Box>
  
  {/* Weight - fixed width */}
  <Box sx={{ minWidth: '80px', flexShrink: 0 }}>
    {/* Chip with fixed width: 80px */}
  </Box>
  
  {/* How-to links - fixed width container */}
  <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', gap: 1, minWidth: '120px', flexShrink: 0, justifyContent: 'flex-end' }}>
    {/* Doc links - 50px box */}
    <Box sx={{ minWidth: '50px' }}>
      {/* Doc chip if present */}
    </Box>
    
    {/* Video links - 50px box */}
    <Box sx={{ minWidth: '50px' }}>
      {/* Video chip if present */}
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>
```

### Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/TasksPanel.tsx**
   - Updated ListItemText primary content structure
   - Added fixed-width containers for each section
   - Wrapped edit button in fixed-width container (40px)

2. **frontend/src/pages/App.tsx**
   - Updated SortableTaskItem component structure
   - Applied same grid-like layout pattern
   - Maintained consistency with TasksPanel appearance

### Visual Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All tasks align in vertical columns
2. **Readability**: Easy to scan across multiple tasks
3. **Professional**: Clean, structured appearance
4. **Predictable**: Users know where to look for each element
5. **Responsive**: Task names truncate gracefully while other elements stay aligned

### Technical Considerations

- Used `flexShrink: 0` on fixed-width containers to prevent compression
- Used `minWidth: 0` on flexible task name container to enable ellipsis truncation
- Maintained `gap: 2` (16px) for comfortable spacing between columns
- Preserved all existing functionality (clicks, hover states, dropdowns)

## Testing

Build completed successfully with no compilation errors. The layout now maintains perfect alignment regardless of:
- Task name length (1 character to very long names)
- Presence or absence of sequence numbers
- Presence or absence of how-to links
- Single vs multiple links
