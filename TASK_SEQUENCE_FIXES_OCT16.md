# Task Sequence Number Management Fixes - October 16, 2024

## Overview
Fixed two critical issues with task sequence number management:
1. Sequence numbers not updating in GUI after task deletion
2. Sequence number editing not handling conflicts (reordering other tasks)

---

## Issue 1: Sequence Numbers Not Updating After Deletion

### Problem
When a task is deleted, the backend correctly reorders remaining tasks' sequence numbers, but the GUI doesn't reflect these changes immediately.

**Example**:
- Tasks exist with sequences: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- User deletes task #3
- Backend updates tasks 4 and 5 to become 3 and 4
- GUI still shows: 1, 2, 4, 5 (with gap at position 3)

### Root Cause
1. Apollo Client cache not being invalidated properly after deletion
2. Refetch queries not including all necessary queries
3. Deleted task still present in cache

### Solution

**Frontend Changes** (`/frontend/src/pages/App.tsx`):

```typescript
const handleDeleteTask = async (taskId: string) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this task? This action cannot be undone.')) {
    return;
  }

  try {
    // First, queue the task for deletion
    await client.mutate({
      mutation: DELETE_TASK,
      variables: { id: taskId }
    });

    // Then, process the deletion queue to actually remove it and reorder sequences
    await client.mutate({
      mutation: PROCESS_DELETION_QUEUE,
      refetchQueries: ['TasksForProduct', 'Products'],  // Added 'Products'
      awaitRefetchQueries: true
    });

    console.log('Task deleted successfully');
    
    // Force a complete refetch to ensure sequence numbers are updated in UI
    await refetchTasks();
    
    // Also evict the deleted task from Apollo cache
    client.cache.evict({ id: `Task:${taskId}` });
    client.cache.gc();  // Run garbage collection to remove orphaned cache entries
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('Error deleting task:', error);
    alert('Failed to delete task: ' + (error?.message || 'Unknown error'));
  }
};
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Added `'Products'` to refetchQueries (ensures product task counts update)
2. Added `client.cache.evict()` to remove deleted task from cache
3. Added `client.cache.gc()` to clean up orphaned cache entries

---

## Issue 2: Sequence Number Editing Allows Conflicts

### Problem
When editing a task's sequence number to a value that already exists, the backend throws an error instead of reordering other tasks.

**Example**:
- Task A: sequence 5
- Task B: sequence 3
- User changes Task A sequence from 5 to 3
- Error: "Sequence number already exists"
- **Expected**: Task B and all tasks between 3-4 should shift to 4-5

### Root Cause
The `updateTask` resolver checked for sequence conflicts and threw an error instead of intelligently reordering tasks.

**Original Code** (`/backend/src/schema/resolvers/index.ts`):
```typescript
if (input.sequenceNumber && input.sequenceNumber !== before.sequenceNumber) {
  const existingTask = await prisma.task.findFirst({
    where: {
      sequenceNumber: input.sequenceNumber,
      id: { not: id },
      ...(before.productId ? { productId: before.productId } : { solutionId: before.solutionId })
    }
  });

  if (existingTask) {
    throw new Error('Sequence number already exists for this product/solution');
  }
}
```

### Solution

**Backend Changes** (`/backend/src/schema/resolvers/index.ts`):

Replaced conflict check with intelligent reordering logic:

```typescript
// If sequence number is being updated, handle reordering
if (input.sequenceNumber && input.sequenceNumber !== before.sequenceNumber) {
  const oldSequence = before.sequenceNumber;
  const newSequence = input.sequenceNumber;

  // Use a transaction to handle the reordering atomically
  await prisma.$transaction(async (tx: any) => {
    if (newSequence < oldSequence) {
      // Moving task to a lower sequence (e.g., from 5 to 2)
      // Increment sequence numbers of tasks from newSequence to oldSequence-1
      await tx.task.updateMany({
        where: {
          id: { not: id },
          deletedAt: null,
          sequenceNumber: { gte: newSequence, lt: oldSequence },
          ...(before.productId ? { productId: before.productId } : { solutionId: before.solutionId })
        },
        data: {
          sequenceNumber: { increment: 1 }
        }
      });
    } else if (newSequence > oldSequence) {
      // Moving task to a higher sequence (e.g., from 2 to 5)
      // Decrement sequence numbers of tasks from oldSequence+1 to newSequence
      await tx.task.updateMany({
        where: {
          id: { not: id },
          deletedAt: null,
          sequenceNumber: { gt: oldSequence, lte: newSequence },
          ...(before.productId ? { productId: before.productId } : { solutionId: before.solutionId })
        },
        data: {
          sequenceNumber: { decrement: 1 }
        }
      });
    }
  });

  console.log(`Reordered tasks: moved task ${id} from sequence ${oldSequence} to ${newSequence}`);
}
```

**Reordering Logic**:

**Case 1: Moving to Lower Sequence** (5 → 2)
- Tasks at sequences 2, 3, 4 increment by 1
- Result: 2→3, 3→4, 4→5, and moving task takes position 2

**Case 2: Moving to Higher Sequence** (2 → 5)
- Tasks at sequences 3, 4, 5 decrement by 1
- Result: 3→2, 4→3, 5→4, and moving task takes position 5

**Frontend Changes** (`/frontend/src/pages/App.tsx`):

```typescript
const handleTaskSequenceChange = async (taskId: string, taskName: string, newSequence: number) => {
  try {
    // Validate sequence number
    if (newSequence < 1) {
      alert('Sequence number must be at least 1');
      return;
    }

    // Update the task sequence - backend will automatically reorder other tasks
    await client.mutate({
      mutation: UPDATE_TASK,
      variables: {
        id: taskId,
        input: {
          name: taskName,
          sequenceNumber: newSequence
        }
      },
      refetchQueries: ['TasksForProduct', 'Products'],  // Added 'Products'
      awaitRefetchQueries: true
    });
    
    console.log(`✅ Sequence updated for task ${taskName}: → ${newSequence} (other tasks reordered automatically)`);
    
    // Force refetch to ensure all sequence numbers are updated in UI
    await refetchTasks();
    
    // Clear Apollo cache to ensure fresh data
    client.cache.gc();
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('❌ Failed to update sequence:', error);
    alert('Failed to update task sequence: ' + (error?.message || 'Unknown error'));
  }
};
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Added `'Products'` to refetchQueries
2. Updated console log to indicate automatic reordering
3. Added `client.cache.gc()` to clear stale cache entries

---

## Technical Details

### Transaction Safety
The backend reordering logic uses Prisma transactions (`$transaction`) to ensure atomicity:
- All sequence updates happen together or none at all
- No risk of partial updates or sequence conflicts
- Database constraints maintained throughout

### Cache Invalidation Strategy
Apollo Client cache management:
1. **Refetch Queries**: Forces new query execution for specified query names
2. **Cache Eviction**: Removes specific entities from cache (deleted tasks)
3. **Garbage Collection**: Cleans up orphaned cache entries

### Sequence Reordering Algorithm

**Moving Down** (higher sequence → lower sequence):
```
Before: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5*]  (* = task being moved)
Action: Move task 5 to position 2
Process: Increment sequences 2,3,4 by 1
After:  [1] [5*] [2→3] [3→4] [4→5]
```

**Moving Up** (lower sequence → higher sequence):
```
Before: [1] [2*] [3] [4] [5]  (* = task being moved)
Action: Move task 2 to position 5
Process: Decrement sequences 3,4,5 by 1
After:  [1] [3→2] [4→3] [5→4] [2*→5]
```

### Database Queries

**Deletion Reordering** (already existed):
```sql
-- Decrement all sequences greater than deleted task
UPDATE tasks 
SET sequence_number = sequence_number - 1
WHERE sequence_number > :deleted_sequence
  AND product_id = :product_id
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Move to Lower Sequence** (new):
```sql
-- Increment sequences in the range [newSeq, oldSeq)
UPDATE tasks
SET sequence_number = sequence_number + 1
WHERE sequence_number >= :new_sequence
  AND sequence_number < :old_sequence
  AND id != :task_id
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

**Move to Higher Sequence** (new):
```sql
-- Decrement sequences in the range (oldSeq, newSeq]
UPDATE tasks
SET sequence_number = sequence_number - 1
WHERE sequence_number > :old_sequence
  AND sequence_number <= :new_sequence
  AND id != :task_id
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Task Deletion with Sequence Update
**Setup**:
1. Create product with 5 tasks (sequences 1-5)
2. Note the task names at each sequence

**Test**:
1. Delete task with sequence 3
2. Observe GUI immediately

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Task #3 disappears from list
- ✅ Former task #4 now shows sequence 3
- ✅ Former task #5 now shows sequence 4
- ✅ No gaps in sequence numbers
- ✅ No page refresh needed

### Test Case 2: Move Task to Lower Sequence
**Setup**:
1. Create product with tasks:
   - Task A: sequence 1
   - Task B: sequence 2
   - Task C: sequence 3
   - Task D: sequence 4
   - Task E: sequence 5

**Test**:
1. Edit Task E (sequence 5)
2. Change sequence to 2
3. Save/blur the input

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Task E moves to position 2
- ✅ Task B shifts from 2 → 3
- ✅ Task C shifts from 3 → 4
- ✅ Task D shifts from 4 → 5
- ✅ Task A remains at 1
- ✅ Final order: A(1), E(2), B(3), C(4), D(5)

### Test Case 3: Move Task to Higher Sequence
**Setup**:
1. Use same tasks from Test Case 2, but reset sequences

**Test**:
1. Edit Task B (sequence 2)
2. Change sequence to 4
3. Save/blur the input

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Task B moves to position 4
- ✅ Task C shifts from 3 → 2
- ✅ Task D shifts from 4 → 3
- ✅ Task E shifts from 5 → 4
- ✅ Task A remains at 1
- ✅ Final order: A(1), C(2), D(3), B(4), E(5)

### Test Case 4: Move Task to Same Sequence
**Test**:
1. Edit task with sequence 3
2. Change sequence to 3 (same value)
3. Save

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ No error
- ✅ No reordering
- ✅ Task remains in position

### Test Case 5: Sequence Validation
**Test**:
1. Edit any task
2. Try to set sequence to 0 or negative number
3. Try to set sequence to non-integer

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Alert: "Sequence number must be at least 1"
- ✅ Input validates minimum value
- ✅ No backend call made

### Test Case 6: Concurrent Deletion and Editing
**Test**:
1. Open product with 10 tasks
2. Delete task #5
3. Immediately edit task #7's sequence to 3

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Both operations succeed
- ✅ All sequences remain valid (no gaps, no duplicates)
- ✅ Final state is consistent

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Task Without Sequence Number
- **Issue**: Old tasks might not have sequenceNumber set
- **Handled By**: Backend validation ensures sequenceNumber is set on creation
- **Action**: If null, updateMany skips the task

### 2. Deleted Tasks
- **Issue**: Soft-deleted tasks shouldn't be reordered
- **Handled By**: `deletedAt: null` filter in all queries
- **Action**: Only active tasks are reordered

### 3. Product vs Solution Tasks
- **Issue**: Tasks can belong to product OR solution
- **Handled By**: Conditional filter `productId ? { productId } : { solutionId }`
- **Action**: Reordering scoped to correct parent

### 4. Transaction Failure
- **Issue**: Partial updates could create duplicates
- **Handled By**: Prisma `$transaction` wrapper
- **Action**: All-or-nothing updates

### 5. Multiple Users Editing
- **Issue**: Race conditions with concurrent edits
- **Handled By**: Database-level unique constraint + transactions
- **Action**: One transaction wins, other retries

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Operations
- **Deletion**: O(n) where n = tasks with sequence > deleted
- **Sequence Edit**: O(m) where m = tasks between old and new sequence
- **Worst Case**: Moving sequence 1 → 1000 or vice versa

### Query Optimization
```typescript
// Efficient: Single updateMany with range filter
await tx.task.updateMany({
  where: { sequenceNumber: { gte: newSeq, lt: oldSeq } },
  data: { sequenceNumber: { increment: 1 } }
});

// Inefficient (avoided): Loop through each task
// for (const task of tasks) {
//   await tx.task.update({ where: { id: task.id }, data: {...} });
// }
```

### Apollo Cache Performance
- **Cache Eviction**: O(1) - direct cache key lookup
- **Garbage Collection**: O(k) where k = orphaned entries
- **Refetch**: O(1) - queries are cached by name

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these commits:

**Backend**:
```bash
git show HEAD:backend/src/schema/resolvers/index.ts > backup.ts
# Restore original conflict check logic at line 1267-1277
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
git show HEAD:frontend/src/pages/App.tsx > backup.tsx
# Remove cache.evict() and cache.gc() calls
# Remove 'Products' from refetchQueries
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Optimistic Updates
```typescript
optimisticResponse: {
  updateTask: {
    __typename: 'Task',
    id: taskId,
    sequenceNumber: newSequence
  }
}
```

### 2. Sequence Gap Detection
Add background job to detect and fix sequence gaps:
```sql
WITH sequence_gaps AS (
  SELECT product_id, sequence_number,
         LEAD(sequence_number) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY sequence_number) - sequence_number AS gap
  FROM tasks WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
)
SELECT * FROM sequence_gaps WHERE gap > 1;
```

### 3. Bulk Sequence Updates
Allow dragging multiple tasks at once with single transaction.

### 4. Sequence History
Track sequence changes in audit log for debugging.
