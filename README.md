# DAP (Data Application Platform)

**Advanced task and product management platform demonstrating complete end-to-end application architecture with comprehensive relationship modeling and optimal user experience.**

## System Overview

DAP represents a sophisticated approach to product development management, where **Tasks represent how products are adopted**. The application showcases optimal architectural patterns with complete data persistence, relationship management, and user workflow optimization.

### Core Concept

- **Products**: Central entities with comprehensive attribute management
- **Tasks**: Implementation units representing product adoption strategies
- **Relationships**: Tasks reference parent Products but maintain independent attributes
- **Scope**: All attributes (Licenses, Outcomes, Releases) are product-scoped
- **Workflow**: Tasks created exclusively through Tasks submenu for optimal UX

## Key Features

## Common Operations

### Product Management

Create a product with licenses and outcomes:

```graphql
mutation {
  createProduct(input: {
    name: "E-Commerce Platform"
    description: "Modern online shopping solution"
    customAttrs: {
      priority: "high"
      technology: "React"
    }
  }) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

Query products with pagination:

```graphql
query {
  products(first: 10) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        name
        description
        licenses {
          id
          name
