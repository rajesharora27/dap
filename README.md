# DAP (Data Application Platform)

**Advanced task and product management platform with comprehensive telemetry, configuration management, and optimal user experience.**

## System Overview

DAP represents a sophisticated approach to product development management, where **Tasks represent how products are adopted**. The application showcases optimal architectural patterns with complete data persistence, relationship management, telemetry tracking, and production-ready configuration management.

### Core Concept

- **Products**: Central entities with comprehensive attribute management
- **Tasks**: Implementation units representing product adoption strategies with telemetry tracking
- **Telemetry**: Comprehensive tracking system with attributes, values, and success criteria
- **Relationships**: Tasks reference parent Products but maintain independent attributes
- **Configuration**: Environment-based deployment system (no hardcoded addresses)
- **Scope**: All attributes (Licenses, Outcomes, Releases) are product-scoped
- **Workflow**: Tasks created exclusively through Tasks submenu for optimal UX

## Next Ideas / TODO

- Proper authentication & JWT issuance
- GraphQL schema directives for auth
- Rich diff visualizations for ChangeSets
- Web UI for CSV import previews
- Task dependency visualization (graph / Gantt)
- Telemetry retention job & metrics aggregation
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
