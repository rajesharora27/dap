## Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Check Sync Status
- Look for ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji on Sync button
- Orange color = sync needed
- Blue color = already synced

### Tip 2: Clear All Filters Quickly
- "Clear Filters" button appears when any filter is active
- One click resets all filters to "All"

### Tip 3: Combine Filters for Precision
- Use multiple filters together
- AND logic: Task must match ALL selected filters
- Great for very specific analysis

### Tip 4: No Tasks Found?
- If "No tasks match the selected filters" appears
- Try less restrictive filter combination
- Or check if tasks actually have that metadata

### Tip 5: Regular Syncing
- Sync after each product release
- Sync when customer license changes
- Sync periodically to stay current

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Sync button doesn't appear
**A**: Make sure:
- Customer has assigned product
- Product has adoption plan created
- You're viewing the adoption plan section

### Q: Filter dropdown is empty
**A**: This means:
- No tasks have that metadata yet
- Example: No tasks tagged with releases
- Add metadata to product tasks first

### Q: Filtering shows no tasks
**A**: Check:
- Are filters too restrictive?
- Do tasks actually have the selected metadata?
- Try clicking "Clear Filters" and start over

### Q: Badges not showing
**A**: Possible causes:
- Tasks don't have metadata assigned
- Update product tasks with licenses, releases, outcomes
- Sync adoption plan to pull in metadata

### Q: Sync not updating tasks
**A**: Verify:
- Product tasks have been updated
- Correct product is selected
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing the page
