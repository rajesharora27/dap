# Backend Startup Fix - October 16, 2025

## Issue
After removing the priority field, the backend failed to start with the error:
```
Error: Unknown type "TaskInput".
```

## Root Cause
The `createTask` mutation in GraphQL type definitions was still referencing `TaskInput` type, which should have been `TaskCreateInput`.

## Fix Applied

**File:** `/data/dap/backend/src/schema/typeDefs.ts`

**Line 431 - Changed:**
```graphql
# Before
createTask(input: TaskInput!): Task!

# After
createTask(input: TaskCreateInput!): Task!
```

## Verification

âœ… Backend started successfully on port 4000
âœ… GraphQL schema validates without errors
âœ… No TypeScript compilation errors
âœ… Health endpoint accessible at http://localhost:4000/health
âœ… GraphQL playground available at http://localhost:4000/graphql

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **RESOLVED** - Backend is now running successfully
