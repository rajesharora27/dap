# License Name Update - Sample Data

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Overview
Updated sample data license names to include the license tier levels (Essential, Advantage, Signature) directly in the license name, following Cisco-style naming conventions.

## Changes Made

### Before
License names used generic terms:
- "Retail Starter", "Retail Professional", "Retail Enterprise"
- "Financial Basic", "Financial Professional", "Financial Enterprise"
- "AI Starter", "AI Professional", "AI Enterprise"
- etc.

### After
License names include product name + license level:
- "Retail Management App Essential", "Retail Management App Advantage", "Retail Management App Signature"
- "Financial Services App Essential", "Financial Services App Advantage", "Financial Services App Signature"
- "AI-Powered Analytics App Essential", "AI-Powered Analytics App Advantage", "AI-Powered Analytics App Signature"
- etc.

## License Level Mapping

| Level | Name | Typical Features |
|-------|------|------------------|
| 1 | **Essential** | Basic/entry-level features for small deployments |
| 2 | **Advantage** | Mid-tier with advanced features for growing businesses |
| 3 | **Signature** | Premium/enterprise features with unlimited capabilities |

## Files Updated

### 1. `/backend/src/seed-clean.ts`
Updated all license names in `licensesByProduct` object:

```typescript
const licensesByProduct = {
  'test-product-1': [
    { name: 'Test E-Commerce Platform Essential', level: 1, description: '...' },
    { name: 'Test E-Commerce Platform Advantage', level: 2, description: '...' },
    { name: 'Test E-Commerce Platform Signature', level: 3, description: '...' }
  ],
  'retail-app-001': [
    { name: 'Retail Management App Essential', level: 1, description: '...' },
    { name: 'Retail Management App Advantage', level: 2, description: '...' },
    { name: 'Retail Management App Signature', level: 3, description: '...' }
  ],
  // ... all other products updated similarly
};
```

### 2. `/backend/src/seed.ts`
Updated all license names in `licensesByProduct` object with same pattern.

## Benefits

### 1. Clarity
- License names now clearly indicate the product and tier
- No ambiguity about which product a license belongs to
- Consistent naming convention across all products

### 2. Cisco-Style Alignment
- Follows industry-standard Cisco licensing model
- Essential → Advantage → Signature progression
- Familiar naming for enterprise customers

### 3. Better UX
- Users can immediately identify license level from name
- Easier to understand license hierarchy
- More professional appearance in UI

### 4. Consistency
- All products follow same naming pattern: `[Product Name] [Level]`
- Level names are consistent: Essential, Advantage, Signature
- Mapping to level numbers (1, 2, 3) remains unchanged

## License Hierarchy

```
Level 3: Signature (Premium/Enterprise)
    ↑ Includes all Advantage features
Level 2: Advantage (Mid-tier/Professional)
    ↑ Includes all Essential features
Level 1: Essential (Basic/Entry-level)
```

## Database Impact

### Existing Data
- If database already has licenses with old names, they will remain unchanged
- Seed scripts use `upsert` logic, checking for existing licenses by name
- New installations will get updated license names
- Existing installations keep old names unless re-seeded

### Re-seeding
To apply updated license names to existing database:

```bash
# Option 1: Full reset (WARNING: deletes all data)
cd backend
npm run seed:clean

# Option 2: Selective update (manual SQL)
# Update individual license names if needed
```

## Testing

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Seed files compile without errors
2. ✅ TypeScript validation passes
3. ⏳ Run seed script to verify licenses created correctly
4. ⏳ Check UI to ensure license names display properly
5. ⏳ Verify license hierarchy logic still works
6. ⏳ Test product assignment with new license names

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run clean seed (creates sample data)
cd backend
npm run seed:clean

# Verify licenses in database
# Check that license names include product name + level
```

## UI Display

### Expected Display Format
When viewing licenses in the UI:

**Before**: "Professional" (unclear which product)
**After**: "Retail Management App Advantage" (clear product + level)

### License Selection
When assigning products to customers:
1. Select product: "Retail Management App"
2. Select license: 
   - Retail Management App Essential
   - Retail Management App Advantage
   - Retail Management App Signature

### Filtering & Sorting
License lists can be:
- Sorted by product name (primary) and level (secondary)
- Filtered by product
- Grouped by license tier

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Short Name Field**: Add `shortName` field for compact display
   - Example: "Essential" as short name, full name for tooltips
2. **License Families**: Group related licenses by product family
3. **Visual Indicators**: Color coding for Essential/Advantage/Signature
4. **Icon Badges**: Icons to represent license tiers
5. **Feature Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of license features

## Backward Compatibility

### API
- No API changes required
- License names are just string values
- Existing queries work unchanged
- GraphQL schema unchanged

### Database Schema
- No schema changes
- Only data values updated
- Migration not required
- Prisma models unchanged

### Frontend
- No code changes required
- License names displayed as-is
- Filtering/sorting logic unchanged
- UI components unchanged

## Related Features

- **License Hierarchy**: Higher levels include lower level features
- **Product Assignment**: Customers select license when assigned product
- **Task Filtering**: Tasks filtered based on license level
- **Status Update Source**: Works independently of license names

## Naming Convention

### Pattern
```
[Product Name] [License Level]
```

### Examples
- ✅ "Retail Management App Essential"
- ✅ "Financial Services App Advantage"
- ✅ "AI-Powered Analytics App Signature"

### Level Names (Required)
