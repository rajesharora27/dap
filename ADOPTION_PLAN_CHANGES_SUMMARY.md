# Quick Summary: Adoption Plan UI Changes

## 3 Key Improvements Made âœ…

### 1. ðŸ“Š Telemetry Column â†’ Details Dialog
**Before:**
- Telemetry shown in table column: "3 attrs"
- Takes up space, low detail

**After:**
- Removed from table
- Full details in task details dialog (double-click)
- Shows all telemetry attributes as chips

**Benefit:** Cleaner table, better context for telemetry data

---

### 2. ðŸŽ¨ NOT_APPLICABLE Tasks Greyed Out
**Visual:**
```
Normal:        [ 1 ] Setup Authentication    10%  [Done]
NOT_APPLICABLE:[ 2 ] Legacy Integration      5%   [Not Applicable]
                â†‘ Greyed out (50% opacity + grey background)
```

**Benefit:** Clear visual distinction of non-applicable tasks

---

### 3. ðŸ’¡ Simplified Hover (Description Only)
**Before (Cluttered):**
- Description
- Updated timestamp
- Updated by user
- Update source chip

**After (Clean):**
- Description only âœ…

**Benefit:** Less visual noise, cleaner interface

## How to Test

### Test 1: View Telemetry
1. Open Adoption Plan
2. Double-click any task
3. Scroll to see "Telemetry Attributes" section
4. Should show chips with attribute names

### Test 2: See Greyed Tasks
1. Find a task with "Not Applicable" status
2. Should appear greyed out (reduced opacity)
3. Should still be clickable
4. Can still change status via dropdown

### Test 3: Hover Behavior
1. Hover over any task
2. Should ONLY show description
3. Should NOT show update timestamp, user, or source

## Table Layout

### Before (7 columns):
```
| # | Task Name | Weight | Status | Updated Via | Telemetry | Actions |
```

### After (6 columns):
```
| # | Task Name | Weight | Status | Updated Via | Actions |
```

**Result:** More space, cleaner interface
