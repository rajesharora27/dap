## 🎤 Key Talking Points

### **Opening Hook**
"What if we could double CSM capacity without hiring?"

### **The Problem**
"CSMs spend 40% of time on manual tracking. Customers wait 6 months for value. We have zero visibility into bundled solutions."

### **The Solution**
"Automated adoption tracking that works like Salesforce for pipeline—structure, automation, and visibility in one platform."

### **The Value**
"$120K/year return on $10K investment. 60% faster planning. 40% faster time-to-value. 800%+ ROI over 3 years."

### **The Ask**
"60-day pilot with 5 customers and 5 CSMs. Clear metrics. Go/no-go decision based on results."

### **The Close**
"This is production-ready. Your team needs this. Your customers will benefit. Are we ready to accelerate customer success?"
