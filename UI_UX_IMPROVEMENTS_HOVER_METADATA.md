# UI/UX Improvements - Release Display and Task Metadata

## Summary
Fixed release display issues and improved task list UX by hiding metadata (license/outcome/release) until hover.

## Changes Made

### 1. Release Query Support (Backend)

#### GraphQL Schema Update
**File**: `backend/src/schema/typeDefs.ts`
- Updated `releases` query to accept optional `productId` parameter
- Before: `releases: [Release!]!`
- After: `releases(productId: ID): [Release!]!`

#### Resolver Update
**File**: `backend/src/schema/resolvers/index.ts`
- Modified `releases` resolver to filter by `productId` when provided
- Allows frontend to fetch only releases for a specific product
- Empty productId returns all releases (backward compatible)

```typescript
releases: async (_: any, { productId }: any) => { 
  if (fallbackActive) return []; 
  const where: any = { deletedAt: null };
  if (productId) where.productId = productId;
  return prisma.release.findMany({ 
    where, 
    orderBy: [{ productId: 'asc' }, { level: 'asc' }] 
  }); 
}
```

### 2. Task Metadata Hover Display (Frontend)

#### State Management
**File**: `frontend/src/components/CustomerAdoptionPanelV4.tsx`
- Added `hoveredTaskId` state to track which task is being hovered
- Type: `string | null`

#### UI Changes
**Task Row Hover Events**:
- Added `onMouseEnter={() => setHoveredTaskId(task.id)}`
- Added `onMouseLeave={() => setHoveredTaskId(null)}`

**Conditional Rendering**:
- Wrapped license/outcome/release chips in conditional: `{hoveredTaskId === task.id && (...)}`
- Chips only appear when mouse hovers over the specific task row
- Improves visual clarity by reducing clutter

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner task list - metadata hidden by default
- Metadata appears on hover for quick reference
- No need to double-click or open details dialog
- Maintains all functionality while improving UX

### 3. Progress Calculation Verification

**Status**: Already Working Correctly âœ…

The backend progress calculation was verified to be correct:
- `calculateProgress()` function only counts filtered (eligible) tasks
- Tasks are filtered by: license level, outcomes, releases
- Non-applicable tasks are never created in adoption plan
- Progress percentage is calculated only from included tasks

**Evidence**:
- `updateCustomerProduct`: Filters tasks with `shouldIncludeTask()` before creating adoption plan
- `createAdoptionPlan`: Only creates tasks that match filters
- `syncAdoptionPlan`: Adds/removes tasks based on current filters
- Progress metrics (`totalTasks`, `completedTasks`, `progressPercentage`) reflect only eligible tasks

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Task list showed license/outcome/release chips for every task
- Visual clutter made it hard to scan task names
- Metadata took up significant vertical space
- Hard to focus on task descriptions

### After
- Task list is clean and easy to scan
- Metadata appears only on hover
- Faster to find specific tasks
- Better use of screen space
- Metadata still easily accessible when needed

## Testing Checklist

### Release Display
- [ ] Open AssignProductDialog
- [ ] Select a product
- [ ] Verify releases appear in release selection section
- [ ] Verify only releases for selected product are shown
- [ ] Select multiple releases
- [ ] Verify confirmation page shows selected releases

### Edit Dialog
- [ ] Open EditEntitlementsDialog
- [ ] Verify current releases are pre-selected
- [ ] Change release selection
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Verify adoption plan regenerates with new release filter

### Task Hover Display
- [ ] Open adoption plan for a customer
- [ ] Verify task list shows only task names/descriptions by default
- [ ] Hover mouse over a task row
- [ ] Verify license/outcome/release chips appear
- [ ] Move mouse away
- [ ] Verify chips disappear
- [ ] Verify behavior works for all tasks

### Progress Calculation
- [ ] Assign product with specific outcomes/releases
- [ ] Verify total tasks count matches filtered tasks only
- [ ] Mark some tasks as complete
- [ ] Verify progress percentage is correct
- [ ] Edit entitlements (change filters)
- [ ] Verify progress resets and new total tasks count is correct

## Technical Notes

### Why Hover Instead of Always Show?
1. **Visual Clarity**: Task lists can have 50+ tasks. Showing chips for all creates visual noise
2. **Screen Real Estate**: Chips take vertical space, reducing visible task count
3. **Scanability**: Users primarily look for task names, not metadata
4. **On-Demand**: Metadata is important but not always needed
5. **Performance**: Fewer DOM elements rendered improves performance

### Why Not Double-Click?
- Hover is more discoverable (happens naturally when using mouse)
- Double-click requires explicit user action
- Hover provides instant feedback
- Double-click is still available for opening full task details

### Backward Compatibility
- Releases query without productId still works (returns all)
- Frontend gracefully handles missing release data
- Hover state defaults to null (no chips shown initially)
- All existing functionality preserved

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Sticky Hover**: Keep chips visible for a few seconds after mouse leaves
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Show chips when task row is focused via keyboard
3. **Mobile Support**: Tap to toggle chips on touch devices
4. **Preferences**: Allow users to choose always-show vs hover-show
5. **Filtering**: Add filter chips above task list to show active filters

### Analytics Opportunities
- Track which tasks users hover over most
- Identify if users need metadata more for certain task types
- Measure if hover improves task completion rate

## Migration Notes

### Database
- No database changes required
- Release query enhancement is additive only

### API
- `releases(productId: ID)` query parameter is optional
- Existing queries without productId continue to work
- No breaking changes

### Frontend
- Component state addition is internal only
- No prop changes to public components
- Backward compatible with existing data

## Performance Impact

### Backend
- Minimal: Release query adds optional WHERE clause
- Database index on `productId` already exists
- No additional queries or joins

### Frontend
- Improved: Fewer chips rendered initially
- Better: React re-renders only on hover state change
- Optimized: Conditional rendering reduces DOM size

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] User guide: Explain hover behavior for task metadata
- [ ] Admin guide: Document release query filtering
- [ ] API docs: Add productId parameter to releases query
- [ ] Release notes: Mention UX improvement
