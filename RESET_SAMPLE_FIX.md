# ‚úÖ FIXED: Reset Sample Data Now Works Correctly

## Issue
`./dap reset-sample` was not removing sample data because it was looking for the wrong product IDs.

## Root Cause

### Mismatch in Product IDs

**Old IDs** (in remove-sample-data.sql):
```
prod-ecommerce-advanced
prod-fintech-suite
prod-healthcare-ecosystem
prod-logistics-optimizer
prod-edtech-platform
```

**New IDs** (in seed.ts):
```
retail-app-001
financial-app-001
it-app-001
ai-app-001
networking-app-001
test-product-1
```

The removal script was targeting products that didn't exist, so nothing was deleted.

## Solution Applied

### Updated `remove-sample-data.sql`

**File**: `/data/dap/remove-sample-data.sql`

Changed all DELETE statements to target the correct product IDs:

```sql
-- Updated to match seed.ts product IDs
DELETE FROM "Product" WHERE id IN (
    'retail-app-001', 
    'financial-app-001', 
    'it-app-001', 
    'ai-app-001', 
    'networking-app-001',
    'test-product-1'
);
```

Also added TelemetryAttribute cleanup (was missing):
```sql
DELETE FROM "TelemetryAttribute" WHERE "taskId" IN (
    SELECT t.id FROM "Task" t 
    JOIN "Product" p ON t."productId" = p.id 
    WHERE p.id IN ('retail-app-001', ...)
);
```

### Enhanced Output Messages

**File**: `/data/dap/dap` (lines 620-643)

Updated the reset_sample_data function to show:
- ‚úÖ List of specific products removed
- ‚úÖ Count of remaining user products
- ‚úÖ Count of remaining user tasks
- ‚úÖ Clear confirmation that user data is preserved

## Verification

### Test Cycle

1. **Add Sample Data**
   ```bash
   ./dap add-sample
   ```
   Result: 5 sample products added (retail, financial, IT, AI, networking)

2. **Remove Sample Data**
   ```bash
   ./dap reset-sample
   ```
   Result:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Sample data removed successfully!
   
   üìä Removed sample products:
     ‚Ä¢ retail-app-001 (Retail Management App)
     ‚Ä¢ financial-app-001 (Financial Services App)
     ‚Ä¢ it-app-001 (IT Operations App)
     ‚Ä¢ ai-app-001 (AI-Powered Analytics App)
     ‚Ä¢ networking-app-001 (Network Management App)
     ‚Ä¢ test-product-1 (Test E-Commerce Platform)
   
   üìä Remaining database contains:
     üì¶ 1 Products (user-created)
     üìã 54 Tasks (user-created)
   
   ‚úÖ User-created data has been preserved
   ```

3. **Verify Database**
   ```bash
   docker exec dap_db_1 psql -U postgres -d dap -c \
     "SELECT name FROM \"Product\" WHERE \"deletedAt\" IS NULL;"
   ```
   Result:
   ```
          name         
   ---------------------
    Cisco Secure Access
   ```
   ‚úÖ Only user product remains!

## What Gets Removed

When you run `./dap reset-sample`, it removes:

1. **Sample Products** (6 total):
   - `retail-app-001` - Retail Management App
   - `financial-app-001` - Financial Services App
   - `it-app-001` - IT Operations App
   - `ai-app-001` - AI-Powered Analytics App
   - `networking-app-001` - Network Management App
   - `test-product-1` - Test E-Commerce Platform

2. **All Associated Data**:
   - ‚úÖ TelemetryAttributes (50+)
   - ‚úÖ TaskOutcome relationships (50+)
   - ‚úÖ TaskRelease relationships (149+)
   - ‚úÖ Tasks (50+ tasks total)
   - ‚úÖ Outcomes (25+)
   - ‚úÖ Releases (25+)
   - ‚úÖ Licenses (15+)
   - ‚úÖ CustomerProduct relationships

3. **User Data Preserved**:
   - ‚ùå Does NOT touch user-created products
   - ‚ùå Does NOT touch user-created tasks
   - ‚ùå Does NOT touch user-created customers
   - ‚ùå Does NOT touch audit logs

## Safety Features

### Targeted Deletion
- Uses specific product IDs (not patterns or wildcards)
- Only deletes data related to known sample product IDs
- Foreign key constraints ensure cascading is handled correctly

### Preservation of User Data
- User products use UUIDs (e.g., `cmgilqsf70001b2qz8edb0p09`)
- Sample products use descriptive IDs (e.g., `retail-app-001`)
- No overlap possible between user and sample IDs

### Idempotent
- Safe to run multiple times
- No errors if sample data already removed
- Shows DELETE 0 for already-removed items

## Usage

### Add Sample Data (Non-Destructive)
```bash
./dap add-sample
```
- Adds 5 comprehensive enterprise products
- Uses upsert (preserves existing data)
- Safe to run multiple times

### Remove Sample Data Only
```bash
./dap reset-sample
```
- Removes only sample products
- Preserves all user-created data
- Shows summary of what remains

### Check Current Data
```bash
docker exec dap_db_1 psql -U postgres -d dap -c \
  "SELECT name, 
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Task\" WHERE \"productId\" = p.id AND \"deletedAt\" IS NULL) as tasks 
   FROM \"Product\" p WHERE \"deletedAt\" IS NULL;"
```

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `/data/dap/remove-sample-data.sql` - Updated all product IDs to match seed.ts
2. ‚úÖ `/data/dap/dap` - Enhanced reset_sample_data() output with detailed reporting

## Testing Commands

### Full Test Cycle
```bash
# 1. Remove any existing sample data
./dap reset-sample

# 2. Add sample data
./dap add-sample

# 3. Verify sample data exists
docker exec dap_db_1 psql -U postgres -d dap -c \
  "SELECT id, name FROM \"Product\" WHERE id LIKE '%-app-%';"

# 4. Remove sample data again
./dap reset-sample

# 5. Verify only user data remains
docker exec dap_db_1 psql -U postgres -d dap -c \
  "SELECT name FROM \"Product\" WHERE \"deletedAt\" IS NULL;"
```

## Status: ‚úÖ FULLY RESOLVED

- ‚úÖ `./dap add-sample` - Non-destructive, preserves user data
- ‚úÖ `./dap reset-sample` - Removes only sample data, preserves user data
- ‚úÖ Both commands can be run multiple times safely
- ‚úÖ Clear output showing what was done and what remains
- ‚úÖ User data always protected

**You can now safely manage sample data without affecting your real data!** üéâ
