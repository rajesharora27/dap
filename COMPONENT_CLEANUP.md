# Component Cleanup - October 16, 2025

## Overview
Removed unused and redundant components to avoid confusion and maintain a clean codebase.

## Components Archived

The following components were moved to `/data/dap/frontend/src/components/_archived/`:

### 1. **TasksPanel.tsx**
- **Reason:** Not used anywhere in the application
- **Status:** The ProductDetailPage.tsx directly renders task cards, making this component redundant
- **Impact:** None - component was never imported or used

### 2. **CustomerAdoptionPanel.tsx** (V1)
- **Reason:** Superseded by V4
- **Current Version:** CustomerAdoptionPanelV4.tsx is actively used
- **Impact:** None - old version not referenced

### 3. **CustomerAdoptionPanelV2.tsx**
- **Reason:** Superseded by V4
- **Impact:** None - old version not referenced

### 4. **CustomerAdoptionPanelV3.tsx**
- **Reason:** Superseded by V4
- **Impact:** None - old version not referenced

### 5. **DataManager_Fixed.tsx**
- **Reason:** Appears to be a test/debug version
- **Current Version:** DataManager.tsx is the active version
- **Impact:** None - not imported anywhere

### 6. **DragTest.tsx**
- **Reason:** Test component for drag functionality
- **Status:** Test code, not needed in production
- **Impact:** None - not imported anywhere

## Active Components (Still in Use)

Based on analysis of `App.tsx` imports, the following components are actively used:

1. **CustomerAdoptionPanelV4.tsx** - Main adoption plan interface
2. **ProductDetailPage.tsx** - Product details and tasks (MODERNIZED)
3. **AuthBar.tsx** - Authentication bar
4. **TaskDetailDialog.tsx** - Task details dialog
5. **AuthContext.tsx** - Authentication context provider
6. **Dialogs:**
   - CustomAttributeDialog.tsx
   - LicenseDialog.tsx
   - OutcomeDialog.tsx
   - ProductDialog.tsx
   - ReleaseDialog.tsx
   - TaskDialog.tsx

## Verification

Verified that:
- ✅ No imports reference the archived components
- ✅ Application compiles successfully after cleanup
- ✅ No broken dependencies
- ✅ HMR working correctly

## Archive Location

All archived components can be found at:
```
/data/dap/frontend/src/components/_archived/
```

These files are preserved for reference but will not be loaded by the application.

## Recommendations

1. **Keep archived for 30 days** - In case any edge case requires restoration
2. **Delete after confirmation** - Once thoroughly tested in production
3. **Document any restoration** - If any component needs to be brought back

## Impact Assessment

- **Build Size:** Slightly reduced (unused imports eliminated)
- **Developer Confusion:** Significantly reduced (no versioned components)
- **Code Maintainability:** Improved (clear which components are active)
- **Risk:** None (archived components were not in use)
