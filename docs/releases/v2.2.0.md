# Release v2.2.0 - Production Hardening & Backup Improvements

**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Status:** Production Ready

## 🚀 New Features

### Backup & Restore
- **Subpath Support:** Fixed backup download URLs to correctly handle `/dap/` subpath.
- **Production Reliability:** Implemented dynamic fallback to `podman exec` for backup/restore operations when native PostgreSQL tools are missing on the host.
- **Container Configuration:** Added `DB_CONTAINER_NAME` support for flexible deployment.

### Deployment & Operations
- **Production Deployment Script:** Enhanced `deploy-to-production.sh` to:
    - Build backend locally (avoiding remote compilation issues).
    - Handle Nginx/Apache detection and restart.
    - Copy environment configuration securely.
    - Fix dependency installation conflicts.
- **GUI Improvements:** Clarified "Build & Deploy" panel to indicate simulation mode.
- **Environment Configuration:** Standardized `.env` files for Dev and Prod, including correct Proxy/CORS settings.

### User Interface
- **Admin Menu:** Fixed "About" menu visibility and positioning.
- **Development Menu:** Strictly hidden in production environment (removed Admin override).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed "404 Not Found" error on backup downloads.
- Fixed `tsc` command not found error during production deployment.
- Fixed `httpd` restart failure by correctly identifying Nginx usage.
- Fixed dependency conflicts (`ERESOLVE`) during remote npm install.
