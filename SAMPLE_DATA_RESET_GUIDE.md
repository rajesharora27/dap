# Sample Data & Customer Reset Documentation

## Overview
Updated the DAP reset script to provide a complete fresh start for customer adoption management by removing all customer product assignments and adoption plans.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `remove-sample-data.sql`

#### New Deletion Steps (in order)
The script now removes customer adoption data in the correct dependency order:

```sql
1. CustomerTelemetryValue       ‚Üí Remove telemetry values
2. CustomerTelemetryAttribute   ‚Üí Remove telemetry attributes  
3. CustomerTaskOutcome          ‚Üí Remove task-outcome relationships
4. CustomerTaskRelease          ‚Üí Remove task-release relationships
5. CustomerTask                 ‚Üí Remove all customer tasks
6. AdoptionPlan                 ‚Üí Remove all adoption plans
7. CustomerProduct              ‚Üí Remove ALL customer-product assignments
8. CustomerSolution             ‚Üí Remove sample customer solutions
```

#### What's Removed
- ‚úÖ **All Customer Adoption Plans** - Complete fresh start
- ‚úÖ **All Customer Product Assignments** - No products assigned to any customer
- ‚úÖ **All Customer Tasks** - No adoption plan tasks
- ‚úÖ **All Customer Telemetry** - No task tracking data
- ‚úÖ **Sample Products** - The 5 sample products and test product
- ‚úÖ **Sample Product Data** - Tasks, licenses, releases, outcomes

#### What's Preserved
- ‚úÖ **Customer Records** - All customer definitions remain
- ‚úÖ **User-Created Products** - Any products you created
- ‚úÖ **User-Created Tasks** - Tasks for your custom products
- ‚úÖ **User Accounts** - Admin and user accounts
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logs** - Historical change tracking

### 2. Updated DAP Script Output

The `./dap reset-sample` command now provides clearer feedback:

```bash
üìä Removed sample products:
  ‚Ä¢ retail-app-001 (Retail Management App)
  ‚Ä¢ financial-app-001 (Financial Services App)
  ‚Ä¢ it-app-001 (IT Operations App)
  ‚Ä¢ ai-app-001 (AI-Powered Analytics App)
  ‚Ä¢ networking-app-001 (Network Management App)
  ‚Ä¢ test-product-1 (Test E-Commerce Platform)

üìä Removed ALL customer adoption data:
  ‚Ä¢ All customer product assignments
  ‚Ä¢ All adoption plans
  ‚Ä¢ All customer tasks and telemetry
  ‚Ä¢ Customer solutions for sample products

üìä Remaining database contains:
  üì¶ X Products (user-created)
  üìã X Tasks (user-created)
  üë• Customers (preserved, but unassigned)

‚úÖ Ready for fresh customer assignments!
```

**Steps**:
```bash
./dap reset-sample
```

**Result**:
- All sample products removed
- All customer product assignments removed
- All adoption plans removed
- Customers remain but unassigned
- Ready to assign products and create adoption plans

### Use Case 2: Reload Sample Data
**Scenario**: Accidentally modified sample products, want to restore original

```bash
./dap reset-sample      # Remove everything
./dap add-sample        # Recreate sample data
```

**Result**:
- Fresh sample products with all tasks
- Clean slate for testing
- All 5 products with complete metadata

### Use Case 3: Test Customer Workflows
**Scenario**: Testing customer adoption workflows from scratch

**Steps**:
```bash
./dap reset-sample                    # Clean state
# In UI: Navigate to Customers
# Assign products to customers
# Create adoption plans
# Test sync functionality
# Test filtering
```

**Result**:
- Clean test environment
- No leftover test data
- Repeatable testing

### Use Case 4: Demo Preparation
**Scenario**: Preparing for product demo

**Steps**:
```bash
./dap reset-sample      # Remove old demo data
./dap add-sample        # Fresh sample products
# Create demo customer assignments
# Set up adoption plans
# Mark some tasks as complete for progress
```

**Result**:
- Clean demo environment
- Professional looking data
- Known starting state

## Common Commands

### Reset Everything (Sample Data + Customer Assignments)
```bash
./dap reset-sample
```
**Removes**: Sample products, ALL customer assignments, ALL adoption plans

### Recreate Sample Data
```bash
./dap add-sample
```
**Creates**: 5 sample products with 15 tasks each, licenses, releases, outcomes

### Complete Restart
```bash
./dap stop              # Stop all services
./dap reset             # Nuclear reset (all data)
./dap start             # Start services
./dap add-sample        # Add sample data
```
**Result**: Completely fresh database with only sample data

### Restart with Sample Data
```bash
./dap clean-restart
```
**Equivalent to**: stop + reset + start + add-sample

## Database Entities

### Sample Products Table

| Product ID | Name | Tasks | Licenses | Releases | Outcomes |
|------------|------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| retail-app-001 | Retail Management App | 15 | 3 | 5 | 5 |
| financial-app-001 | Financial Services App | 15 | 3 | 5 | 5 |
| it-app-001 | IT Operations App | 15 | 3 | 5 | 5 |
| ai-app-001 | AI-Powered Analytics App | 15 | 3 | 5 | 5 |
| networking-app-001 | Network Management App | 15 | 3 | 5 | 5 |

**Total**: 75 tasks, 15 licenses, 25 releases, 25 outcomes

### Customer Adoption Entities

| Entity | Description | Removed by reset-sample |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Customer | Customer definition | ‚ùå Preserved |
| CustomerProduct | Product assignment to customer | ‚úÖ Removed (ALL) |
| AdoptionPlan | Adoption plan for customer-product | ‚úÖ Removed (ALL) |
| CustomerTask | Task copy in adoption plan | ‚úÖ Removed (ALL) |
| CustomerTelemetryAttribute | Telemetry tracking for customer task | ‚úÖ Removed (ALL) |
| CustomerTelemetryValue | Telemetry values | ‚úÖ Removed (ALL) |

## Verification

### Check Sample Products
```bash
./dap status
```
Look for product count in status output.

### Check Customer Assignments (via GraphQL)
```graphql
query {
  customers {
    id
    name
    products {
      id
      product {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Expected after reset-sample**: Customers exist but `products` array is empty

### Check Adoption Plans (via GraphQL)
```graphql
query {
  customers {
    id
    name
    products {
      id
      adoptionPlan {
        id
        totalTasks
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**Expected after reset-sample**: No `adoptionPlan` data

## Troubleshooting

### Q: reset-sample fails with foreign key constraint errors
**A**: The SQL script handles dependencies in the correct order. If you still get errors:
```bash
./dap stop
./dap reset              # Nuclear reset
./dap start
./dap add-sample         # Fresh sample data
```

### Q: Customers disappeared after reset-sample
**A**: This shouldn't happen. The script preserves Customer records. Check:
```bash
docker exec <db_container> psql -U postgres -d dap -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Customer\";"
```
If count is 0, customers were accidentally removed. Recreate them in the UI.

### Q: Sample products not appearing after add-sample
**A**: Check seed script ran successfully:
```bash
./dap add-sample
# Look for: "Created product: <name>"
# Look for: "Created task: <name>"
```

### Q: Tasks missing from sample products
**A**: This was the original issue. The seed script creates tasks. Verify:
```bash
docker exec <db_container> psql -U postgres -d dap -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"Task\" WHERE \"productId\" = 'retail-app-001';"
```
**Expected**: 15 tasks

## Best Practices

### Before Demo
```bash
./dap reset-sample      # Clean slate
./dap add-sample        # Fresh data
# Create demo scenarios in UI
```

### Before Testing
```bash
./dap reset-sample      # Remove test data
# Run tests with clean state
```

### Before Development
```bash
./dap clean-restart     # Full reset
# Develop with known state
```

### Periodic Cleanup
```bash
# Every few days:
./dap reset-sample      # Remove accumulated test data
./dap add-sample        # Fresh sample data
```

## Summary

The `reset-sample` command now provides a **complete fresh start** for customer adoption management:

‚úÖ **Removes**: Sample products, ALL customer-product assignments, ALL adoption plans, ALL customer tasks
‚úÖ **Preserves**: Customer definitions, user accounts, user-created products, audit logs
‚úÖ **Result**: Clean state ready for fresh product assignments and adoption plan creation

**Command**: `./dap reset-sample`

**Use when**: You want to start fresh with customer adoption management or prepare for demos/testing
