# Bug Fixes - Progress Bar, Task Details, and Customer Persistence

## Summary
Fixed three critical UX issues:
1. Progress bar not updating when filters are applied
2. Double-click on tasks not working (no details dialog)
3. Customer menu not remembering last selected customer

## Changes Made

### 1. Progress Bar Updates with Filtering ✅

#### Problem
The progress bar always showed total adoption plan stats (e.g., 10/50 tasks, 20%) even when filters were applied. If the user filtered to show only 5 tasks with 3 completed, the bar still showed 10/50.

#### Solution
**File**: `frontend/src/components/CustomerAdoptionPanelV4.tsx`

**Added Filtered Progress Calculation**:
```typescript
const filteredProgress = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (!filteredTasks.length) return { totalTasks: 0, completedTasks: 0, percentage: 0 };
  
  const completedTasks = filteredTasks.filter((task: any) => task.status === 'COMPLETED').length;
  const percentage = (completedTasks / filteredTasks.length) * 100;
  
  return {
    totalTasks: filteredTasks.length,
    completedTasks,
    percentage: Math.round(percentage * 10) / 10, // Round to 1 decimal
  };
}, [filteredTasks]);
```

**Updated Progress Display**:
- Changed from `planData.adoptionPlan.completedTasks / planData.adoptionPlan.totalTasks`
- To: `filteredProgress.completedTasks / filteredProgress.totalTasks`
- Changed percentage from `planData.adoptionPlan.progressPercentage`
- To: `filteredProgress.percentage`

**Added Visual Indicator**:
- Shows "Filtered" chip when any filter is active
- Helps users understand they're viewing filtered data
- Color: info (blue)

#### Behavior
- **No Filters**: Shows total adoption plan progress (e.g., 10/50 tasks, 20%)
- **With Filters**: Shows filtered progress (e.g., 3/5 tasks, 60%) + "Filtered" chip
- **Dynamic**: Recalculates instantly when filters change
- **Accurate**: Only counts tasks that match current filters

### 2. Task Details Dialog (Double-Click) ✅

#### Problem
Double-clicking on tasks did nothing. No way to view full task details without opening external docs.

#### Solution
**File**: `frontend/src/components/CustomerAdoptionPanelV4.tsx`

**Added State Management**:
```typescript
const [taskDetailsDialogOpen, setTaskDetailsDialogOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedTask, setSelectedTask] = useState<any>(null);
```

**Added Double-Click Handler**:
```typescript
<TableRow 
  onDoubleClick={() => {
    setSelectedTask(task);
    setTaskDetailsDialogOpen(true);
  }}
  sx={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
>
```

**Created Task Details Dialog**:
Displays comprehensive read-only task information:
- **Basic Info**: Name, description, sequence number, weight
- **Status**: Current status with color-coded chip
- **License Level**: Required license
- **Releases**: All releases this task belongs to
- **Outcomes**: All outcomes this task contributes to
- **Time Estimate**: Estimated minutes
- **Priority**: Task priority level
- **Documentation**: Link to how-to docs
- **Video Tutorial**: Link to video guide
- **Notes**: Any additional notes
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp and user who updated

#### User Experience
- **Double-click** any task row to open details
- **Read-only** view - information only, no editing
- **Full screen** dialog with all task metadata
- **Scroll support** for long descriptions
- **Close button** to dismiss
- **Responsive** layout adapts to content

### 3. Customer Selection Persistence ✅

#### Problem
When navigating to "Customers" menu, the app always showed the first customer. User had to manually re-select their customer every time they switched sections.

#### Solution
**File**: `frontend/src/pages/App.tsx`

**Added localStorage Persistence**:

**Initialize from localStorage**:
```typescript
const [selectedCustomerId, setSelectedCustomerId] = useState<string | null>(() => {
  return localStorage.getItem('lastSelectedCustomerId');
});
```

**Smart Customer Selection**:
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedSection === 'customers' && customers.length > 0 && !selectedCustomerId) {
    const lastCustomerId = localStorage.getItem('lastSelectedCustomerId');
    // Check if last selected customer still exists
    const customerExists = lastCustomerId && customers.some((c: any) => c.id === lastCustomerId);
    const customerId = customerExists ? lastCustomerId : customers[0].id;
    setSelectedCustomerId(customerId);
    if (customerId) {
      localStorage.setItem('lastSelectedCustomerId', customerId);
    }
  }
}, [selectedSection, customers, selectedCustomerId]);
```

**Auto-Persist on Change**:
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedCustomerId) {
    localStorage.setItem('lastSelectedCustomerId', selectedCustomerId);
  }
}, [selectedCustomerId]);
```

#### Behavior
- **First Visit**: Selects first customer, saves to localStorage
- **Return Visit**: Restores last selected customer automatically
- **Customer Deleted**: Falls back to first customer if saved one is missing
- **Persists Across Sessions**: Survives page refresh, browser restart
- **Per Browser**: Each browser/device remembers independently

## Testing Checklist

### Progress Bar Filtering
- [ ] Open adoption plan with multiple tasks
- [ ] Verify progress shows total (e.g., 10/50 tasks)
- [ ] Apply license filter

## Technical Details

### Progress Calculation Logic
```typescript
// Only counts filtered tasks
const completedTasks = filteredTasks.filter(task => task.status === 'COMPLETED').length;
const percentage = (completedTasks / filteredTasks.length) * 100;
```

**Key Points**:
- Uses `filteredTasks` array (already filtered by release/license/outcome)
- Recalculates every time filters change (useMemo dependency)
- Rounds to 1 decimal place for display
- Returns 0% if no tasks match filters

### Task Details Data Flow
1. User double-clicks task row
2. `setSelectedTask(task)` stores full task object
3. `setTaskDetailsDialogOpen(true)` shows dialog
4. Dialog renders all task properties from `selectedTask`
5. User clicks "Close"
6. Dialog closes, state remains until next open

### localStorage Schema
```typescript
Key: 'lastSelectedCustomerId'
Value: string (customer ID) | null
Example: "cmgr0dwdp0000b2xtk8wno4c7"
```

**Storage Strategy**:
- Saves immediately when customer is selected
- Loads on component mount
- Validates customer still exists before using
- Falls back gracefully if customer deleted

## Performance Impact

### Progress Calculation
- **Minimal**: Uses memoization (useMemo)
- **Efficient**: Only recalculates when filteredTasks changes
- **Fast**: Simple filter + count operations
- **No Backend Calls**: Pure frontend calculation

### Task Details Dialog
- **Lightweight**: Only renders when open
- **No Extra Queries**: Uses existing task data
- **Responsive**: Opens instantly (no loading)

### localStorage Persistence
- **Fast**: Synchronous read/write operations
- **Small**: Only stores customer ID (string)
- **No Backend Impact**: Pure frontend feature
- **Reliable**: Built-in browser API

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
1. **Confusing Progress**: Bar showed total even when filtered
2. **No Task Details**: Had to rely on hover or external docs
3. **Repetitive Selection**: Had to re-select customer every time

### After
1. **Accurate Progress**: Bar reflects filtered view + visual indicator
2. **Full Task Info**: Double-click for comprehensive details
3. **Persistent Selection**: Customer remembered across sessions

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Progress History**: Track progress over time
2. **Filter Presets**: Save favorite filter combinations
3. **Task Comments**: Add customer-specific notes to tasks
4. **Export Progress**: Generate progress reports
5. **Product Persistence**: Remember last selected product too
6. **Multi-Customer Support**: Remember selections per workspace

## Browser Compatibility

### localStorage Support
- ✅ Chrome/Edge: Full support
- ✅ Firefox: Full support
- ✅ Safari: Full support
- ✅ Mobile browsers: Full support
- ⚠️ Private/Incognito: Not persisted (expected behavior)

### Fallback Behavior
- If localStorage blocked: Defaults to first customer (no errors)
- If storage full: Overwrites with new value
- If customer deleted: Falls back to first available

## Documentation Updates Needed

- [ ] User guide: Explain filtered progress indicator
- [ ] User guide: Document double-click to view task details
- [ ] User guide: Mention customer selection persistence
- [ ] Release notes: List all three improvements
