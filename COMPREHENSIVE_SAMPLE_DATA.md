# Comprehensive Sample Data Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced sample data to include 10-15 comprehensive tasks per product with detailed attributes and non-destructive update logic.

## Date
October 8, 2025

## Objectives
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 10-15 tasks per product (not just 6)
2. **Rich Attributes**: All fields populated with realistic data
3. **Non-Destructive**: Sample data scripts must not impact existing data

## Sample Data Protection Strategy

### Current Implementation
The seed script uses `upsert` for products, outcomes, licenses, and releases:
```typescript
const product = await prisma.product.upsert({
  where: { id: productInfo.id },
  update: {},  // Don't update existing
  create: productInfo  // Only create if new
});
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Task Creation**: Currently uses `findFirst` + conditional create
2. **No Update Protection**: Could potentially modify existing tasks
3. **Duplicate Risk**: Same task name could be created multiple times

### Recommended Improvements

#### 1. Use Composite Unique Keys
```typescript
const existing = await prisma.task.findFirst({ 
  where: { 
    name: taskInfo.name, 
    productId: product.id 
  } 
});
```

#### 2. Skip Existing Tasks Entirely
```typescript
if (!existing) {
  // Only create new tasks
  const task = await prisma.task.create({ data: ... });
} else {
  console.log(`[seed] Skipping existing task: ${taskInfo.name}`);
}
```

#### 3. Add Sample Data Markers
```typescript
customAttrs: {
  ...existingAttrs,
  _sampleData: true,  // Mark as sample data
  _seedVersion: '2.0'  // Track seed version
}
```

## Task Attributes Completeness

### Required Fields
- âœ… name
- âœ… description
- âœ… productId
- âœ… estMinutes
- âœ… weight (decimal with 2 places)
- âœ… sequenceNumber
- âœ… priority
- âœ… notes
- âœ… howToDoc (array of URLs)
- âœ… howToVideo (array of URLs)
- âœ… licenseLevel

### Optional Fields (should populate)
- customAttrs - Product-specific metadata
- deletedAt - NULL for active tasks

### Associations
- âœ… Outcomes - via TaskOutcome join table
- âœ… Releases - via TaskRelease join table
- âœ… Licenses - via licenseLevel field
- ðŸ”„ Custom Attributes - Need to add
- ðŸ”„ Telemetry Attributes - Currently added separately

## Task Distribution Strategy

### By License Level
- **ESSENTIAL**: 40-50% of tasks (core functionality)
- **ADVANTAGE**: 30-40% of tasks (enhanced features)
- **SIGNATURE**: 20-30% of tasks (premium features)

### By Priority
- **Critical**: 20-30% (security, compliance, core business)
- **High**: 40-50% (important features)
- **Medium**: 20-30% (nice-to-have)
- **Low**: 5-10% (future enhancements)

### Weight Distribution
- Ensure total = 100% per product
- Range: 4-11% per task (for 10-15 tasks)
- Critical tasks: 8-11%
- Medium tasks: 6-8%
- Low priority: 4-6%

## Documentation Links Strategy

### Multiple Links Per Task
Each task should have 2-3 documentation links and 1-2 video links:

```typescript
howToDoc: [
  'https://docs.domain.com/primary-guide',
  'https://docs.domain.com/api-reference',
  'https://docs.domain.com/best-practices'
],
howToVideo: [
  'https://youtube.com/watch?v=tutorial-part-1',
  'https://youtube.com/watch?v=tutorial-part-2'
]
```

### Domain-Specific URLs
- Retail: `docs.retail.com`
- Financial: `docs.fintech.com`
- IT Ops: `docs.itops.com`
- AI/ML: `docs.ai-platform.com`
- Networking: `docs.netops.com`

## Testing Requirements

### Before Deployment
1. âœ… Run seed script on empty database
2. âœ… Run seed script on populated database (verify no duplicates)
3. ðŸ”„ Run seed:clean script
4. ðŸ”„ Verify existing data untouched
5. ðŸ”„ Check weight totals = 100% per product
6. ðŸ”„ Verify all URLs are arrays
7. ðŸ”„ Confirm outcome/release associations

### Validation Queries
```sql
-- Check weight totals per product
SELECT productId, SUM(weight) as total_weight
FROM Task
WHERE deletedAt IS NULL
GROUP BY productId;

-- Should return 100.00 for each product

-- Check for duplicate tasks
SELECT name, productId, COUNT(*) as count
FROM Task
GROUP BY name, productId
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Should return no results

-- Verify sample data markers
SELECT id, name, customAttrs
FROM Product
WHERE customAttrs->>'_sampleData' = 'true';
```

## Migration Path

### For Existing Installations
1. Backup database before running seed
2. Run `npm run seed` - will only add new sample data
3. Existing products/tasks remain untouched
4. New sample products created with sample marker

### For New Installations
1. Run `npm run seed` after initial setup
2. Gets full comprehensive sample data
3. Ready for demo/testing immediately

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. âœ… Expand Retail App to 15 tasks
2. âœ… Expand Financial App to 14 tasks
3. ðŸ”„ Expand IT Ops App to 12-13 tasks
4. ðŸ”„ Expand AI App to 12-13 tasks
5. ðŸ”„ Expand Networking App to 12-13 tasks

### Follow-up
1. Add custom attributes per domain
2. Create domain-specific telemetry attributes
3. Add more realistic outcome descriptions
4. Create sample solutions using these products
5. Add sample user assignments

## Benefits

### 1. Realistic Testing
- Comprehensive task lists mirror real projects
- Proper weight distribution for scheduling
- Multiple links per task reflect documentation reality

### 2. Better Demos
- 10-15 tasks per product shows scalability
- Rich attributes demonstrate all features
- Professional appearance for sales demos

### 3. Development Quality
- Tests pagination with realistic data volumes
- Exercises all UI components fully
- Validates performance with proper data sets

### 4. Production Safety
- Non-destructive updates protect customer data
- Sample data clearly marked
- Easy to identify and remove if needed
